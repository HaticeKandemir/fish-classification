# Fish Classification

## Dataset

This dataset contains 9 different seafood types collected from a supermarket in Izmir, Turkey, as part of a university-industry collaboration project at Izmir University of Economics. This work was published in ASYU 2020. The dataset includes image samples of the following seafood types:

- Gilt Head Bream
- Red Sea Bream
- Sea Bass
- Red Mullet
- Horse Mackerel
- Black Sea Sprat
- Striped Red Mullet
- Trout
- Shrimp

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the classification of different seafood types using image recognition techniques, specifically employing deep learning with artificial neural networks (ANN). The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing a fully connected neural network architecture.

### Key Features:
- **Image Preprocessing**: Images in the dataset are resized and normalized to enhance model performance.
- **Model Architecture**: The model consists of multiple dense layers with dropout applied for regularization, ensuring effective learning.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained on a portion of the dataset, validated on another portion, and evaluated to assess its accuracy.

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to accurately classify seafood types, assisting in the identification and promotion of various seafood products.
